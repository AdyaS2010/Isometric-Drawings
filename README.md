# Isometric Drawing Project

Welcome to my Isometric Drawing Project! This project is designed to help you learn and become proficient in creating isometric drawings. Isometric drawings are a method of visually representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. This README will guide you through the basics and provide resources to help you get started.

## Introduction
Isometric drawings are a great way to represent three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional space. They are commonly used in engineering, architecture, and video game design. This project will help you understand the principles of isometric drawing and provide you with the tools to create your own.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need:
- A basic understanding of geometry
- A drawing tool (pencil and paper, or a digital drawing tool like Adobe Illustrator or Sketch)
- A ruler or a grid for precision

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `examples/`: Contains example isometric drawings for reference
- `tutorials/`: Step-by-step tutorials on creating isometric drawings
- `resources/`: Additional resources and references

## How to Create Isometric Drawings
1. **Understand the Basics**: Learn about the principles of isometric projection, including the 30-degree angles and the equal scaling of all three axes.
2. **Set Up Your Grid**: Use a grid to help you maintain the correct angles and proportions. You can find isometric grid templates online or create your own.
3. **Start Drawing**: Begin by drawing simple shapes like cubes and prisms. Practice creating more complex objects as you become more comfortable with the technique.
4. **Add Details**: Once you have the basic shapes, add details to make your drawing more realistic. Pay attention to shading and perspective to enhance the three-dimensional effect.
